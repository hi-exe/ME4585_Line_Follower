# ME4585_Line_Follower
This is the repository for the winning robot of the annual robot competition based out of Winterthur, Switzerland.

**Main Fast**

This file is the main cpp file for track one "Pedal to the Metal" and is designed to be the fastest and most efficient line follower program.
This file primarily uses the pre-built line following the program, given to my team by Pichim.
Adjustments were made to a few of the constant values such as wheel diameter, wheelbase, and sensor distance.

**Main Track 2**

This is the main cpp file for Track 2 "Brain Washer". This code uses the customizable code for line-following that uses the sensorbar library. 
This is necessary to code custom parameters to overcome obstacles. 
This code uses a case machine to switch between states for each obstacle, where each case contains the necessary instructions to overcome the obstacle.

**Main Track 3**

This is the main cpp file for Track 3 "Over and Around".
