# ME4585_Line_Follower
This is the repository for the winning robot of the annual robot competition based out of Winterthur, Switzerland.

**Main Fast**
This file is the main cpp file for track one "Pedal to the Metal" and is designed to be the fastest and most efficient line follower program.
This file primarily uses the pre-built line following the program, given to my team by Pichim.
Adjustments were made to a few of the constant values such as wheel diameter, wheelbase, and sensor distance.

**Main Track 2**
This is the main cpp file for Track 2 "Brain Washer".
